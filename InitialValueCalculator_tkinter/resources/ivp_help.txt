New Solution
        The application will open to a blank solution by default
        To close the current solution and create a new one choose File -> New Solution from the main menu, or press [Ctrl + Shift + N] on the keyboard
        
        
Print Solution
        To typeset the Initial Value Problem and Solution choose File -> Print Solutin from the main menu, or press [Ctrl + Shift + P] on the keyboard
        
        

Input an Intial Value Problem
        Enter the functions for u(t) --the x axis-- and v(t) --the y axis-- in the appropriate input box,
        If only one function is needed use u(t) and leave v(t) blank
        Enter the function in Python syntax with t as a variable, the standard Python math library is available
        
        Enter the intial values, if only one intial value is needed use u(0) and leave v(0) blank
        
        Enter the desired length of time intervals to calculate the solutions on
        
        Input continuous funtions in python syntax and input discrete time functions as a comma separated list of values
