

Initial Value Problem Calculator, Using Euler Method


New Solution
        The application will open to a blank solution by default
        To close the current solution and create a new one choose File -> New Solution from the main menu, or press [Ctrl + Shift + N] on the keyboard
    

    **********************************  
  
      
Save Solution
        After filling out all input fields you may save the Initial Value problem to a ".ivp" file, simply select File -> Save Solution from the main menu or press [Ctrl + s] on the keyboard
        NOTE: This feature only saves the text entered into the input fields
        

    **********************************  
    
            
Open Solution
        If there is a saved ".ivp" file select File -> Open Solution from the main menu, or press [Ctrl + Shift + O] on the keyboard to browse to the file's location and open it
        The application includes a saved version of a Lorenz Attractor for an example on how to input the IVP.
        NOTE: The save feature only includes the text for the input fields so the solve button will need to be clicked to get the solution

Clear Plot Area
        To clear the plot area select Tools -> Clear Plots from the main menu, or press [Ctrl + Shift + L] on the keyboard

Input an Intial Value Problem
        Enter the functions for u(t) --the x axis-- and v(t) --the y axis-- in the appropriate input box,
        If only one function is needed use u(t) and leave v(t) blank
        Enter the function in Python syntax with t as a variable, the standard Python math library is available
        
        Enter the intial values, if only one intial value is needed use u(0) and leave v(0) blank
        
        Enter the desired length of time intervals to calculate the solutions on
        
        Input continuous funtions in python syntax and input discrete time functions as a comma separated list of values
        
        Input the differential function using "u", "v", and "t" as the variables, and use an ampersand (&) to separate functions for a piecewise function, the differential cannot be a discrete set of values
